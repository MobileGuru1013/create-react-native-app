# READ THIS FIRST, PLEASE!

The App Store version of the Expo iOS client recently had to remove the QR code scanner from the app. If you intend to load your app on a physical iOS device, please install the latest version of react-native-scripts to your app (`yarn add react-native-scripts@latest` or `npm install react-native-scripts@latest`). It adds the "s" key to the interactive prompt, which asks you to enter an email address or phone number and then sends the URL to your device.
